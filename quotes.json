Suppose one day you get business worth 100,000 dollars, and another day you don't get any business. It doesn't matter, because your connection with the master is there and so you get your salary. When the profit is 100,000 dollars, you don't expect any profit, and when there is no business, there is no loss on your part. Siddhy-asiddhyoh.",

I am thinking, 'This money is required, otherwise God's service will be stopped.' So while earning money in my office, my God consciousness is there. Therefore, even while earning, whatever the process may be, you are yoga-sthah, situated in yoga. You get some money and go to the market. You are thinking, 'Oh, this is a very nice thing. It can be offered to Lord Kṛṣṇa.' Just like sometimes you bring some fruit for me, thinking, out of your love, 'Swamiji will eat this and he will like it.' Out of love, you think of Swamiji, and Swamiji is thought of because he is in relation with God. So this is God consciousness. It is just like electricity. Anything connected with the powerhouse is surcharged with electricity.",
